[A Life Engineered](https://www.youtube.com/@ALifeEngineered) lists [So Good They Can't Ignore You](https://www.calnewport.com/books/so-good/) as a great inspiration in his video description.

Having read some of it, I've been inspired to take a craftsman's approach to a career in software engineering.

The "craftsman's approach" focuses on maximizing the value you can offer to the world as opposed to following your passion in your job.

Having rare value to offer will lead to valuable job opportunities and the prototypical elements of what makes "dream jobs": autonomy, creativity, impactful, and rewarding (financially and emotionally).

## The 4 areas of a software engineer

To complement this, I am going to categorize my blog posts into the 4 main areas I believe a software engineer operates in.

1. Research: this includes any posts related to how to become a better learner, researcher, etc in software engineering and life.
1. Design: design and architecture problems and posts.
2. Implementation: posts related to implementations e.g. DS&A, libraries, etc.
3. Testing and debugging: posts related to testing, CI/CD, debugging, and tooling related to that.
4. Stakeholder management: posts related to communication, project management, and other soft skills.
