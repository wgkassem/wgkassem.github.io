This is my first post, and it's going to be about how I set up this website: how I got the dependencies and how I was able to publish to github pages.\n\nGetting this website up and running required one night's worth of work. So, if you want to dot the same for your github page, here's how you can do it:\n\n## Getting dependencies and development container\n\n0. [hexo-icarus-theme](https://github.com/ppoffice/hexo-theme-icarus) is the main dependency of this site. To avoid accidentally breaking your website should the theme be updated *AND* for future customization-ility, we are going to fork the theme repo on Github and pull it locally.\n```\n# dont forget to fork on GH first\ngh repo clone <your-gh-username>/hexo-icarus-theme\n```\n\n1. Let's create a new repo to hold the website source tree. This will be the repo that you will push to Github Pages.\n```\nmkdir $USER.github.io\ncd $USER.github.io\ngit init\n```\nYou might want to change `$USER` to your Github user or organization name.\n\n2. Next is a Dockerfile that will build your site locally in a \"controlled environment\": no polluting your machine with node stuff, development isolation, etc\n```Dockerfile\n# Dockerfile\n\n## Base and dependencies\nFROM node:22.5.1-alpine3.19 AS base\nWORKDIR /workspace\nRUN npm install -g hexo-cli\n\n## Copy sources for build\nFROM base AS build\nCOPY . /workspace\nRUN hexo generate\n\n## Deploy\nFROM nginx:1.21.3-alpine\nCOPY --from=build /workspace/dist /usr/share/nginx/html\nEXPOSE 80\nCMD [\"nginx\", \"-g\", \"daemon off;\"]\n```\n\n3.

For more information.\n\n## Deploying to Github Pages\n\nThe easiest way to deploy to Github pages is to follow the example from [deploy-pages action](https://github.com/actions/deploy-pages).\nCheckout my [workflow](https://github.com/wgkassem/wgkassem.github.io/blob/main/.github/workflows/pages.yml) for this website.\n\n","source":"_posts/hello-world.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Hello World\ndate: 2024-10-16\n---\n\nWelcome to my website! This is my first post, and it's going to be about how I set up this website: how I got the dependencies and how I was able to publish to github pages.\n\nGetting this website up and running required one night's worth of work. So, if you want to dot the same for your github page, here's how you can do it:\n\n## Getting dependencies and development container\n\n0. [hexo-icarus-theme](https://github.com/ppoffice/hexo-theme-icarus) is the main dependency of this site. To avoid accidentally breaking your website should the theme be updated *AND* for future customization-ility, we are going to fork the theme repo on Github and pull it locally.\n```\n# dont forget to fork on GH first\ngh repo clone <your-gh-username>/hexo-icarus-theme\n```\n\n1. Let's create a new repo to hold the website source tree. This will be the repo that you will push to Github Pages.\n```\nmkdir $USER.github.io\ncd $USER.github.io\ngit init\n```\nYou might want to change `$USER` to your Github user or organization name.\n\n2. Next is a Dockerfile that will build your site locally in a \"controlled environment\": no polluting your machine with node stuff, development isolation, etc\n```Dockerfile\n# Dockerfile\n\n## Base and dependencies\nFROM node:22.5.1-alpine3.19 AS base\nWORKDIR /workspace\nRUN npm install -g hexo-cli\n\n## Copy sources for build\nFROM base AS build\nCOPY . /workspace\nRUN hexo generate\n\n## Deploy\nFROM nginx:1.21.3-alpine\nCOPY --from=build /workspace/dist /usr/share/nginx/html\nEXPOSE 80\nCMD [\"nginx\", \"-g\", \"daemon off;\"]\n```\n\n3. Add a .devcontainer for development purposes (things might break and you might want to debug why)\n\n```yaml\n# .devcontainer/compose.yml\nservices:\n  web:\n    build:\n      context: .\n      dockerfile: Dockerfile\n    image: my-website-server\n    ports:\n      - \"80:80\"\n```\n\n4. You can now init the site, add icarus theme as a submodule, and start the server\n\n```bash\ndocker compose -f ./devcontainer/compose.yml up -d --build\ndocker compose -f ./devcontainer/compose.yml exec hexo init .\ngit submodule add https://github.com/<your-gh-username>/hexo-icarus-theme themes/icarus\n# you might need to run `npm install <some-packages>` to get things working\n# dont forget to set icarus as the theme in _config.yml\ndocker compose -f ./devcontainer/compose.yml exec hexo server\n```\n\n5. Get the [experimental dark theme](https://github.com/ppoffice/hexo-theme-icarus/issues/564) and apply it\n\n```bash\ncd themes/icarus\ngit checkout night4\ngit remote add imaegoo https://github.com/imaegoo/hexo-theme-icarus.git\ngit fetch imaegoo\ngit merge imaegoo/night4\n```\n\n6. add .gitignore for things like `node_modules` etc\n\n7. fix the `_config.yml` and `_config.icarus.yml` to your liking.\n\nMake sure to follow [icarus docs](https://ppoffice.github.io/hexo-theme-icarus/).

This has led to non-reproducible builds and a lot of confusion. Here's how we can fix it.\n\n## One: switch from `git submodule` to `npm` for theme package\n\nPreviously, we used `git submodule` to add the theme to the blog.\nThis caused some issues, as the theme was also a npm package with its own dependencies and build process. `hexo generate` would build them concurrently.\n\nWe added the theme [git repo to package.json](https://github.com/wgkassem/wgkassem.github.io/blob/main/package.json).\n\n\n## Two: switch from `npm install` to `npm ci` in base target\n\nCurrent blog is packaged with npm [1]: <https://docs.npmjs.com/about-packages-and-modules>. The base needs to provide the necessary dependencies for the blog to build.\n\nTwo files are important here:\n\n1. package.json: specifies the package name, version, and dependencies.\n2. package-lock.json\n\nWe *do not* want to use `npm install` here because:\n\n1. it does not delete `node_modules` tree.\n2. it modifies `package.json` if a new package is added.\n3. it generates `package-lock.json` to describe the exact tree that was generated.\n\nLeading to **non-reproducible** builds.\n\nFor instance, consider calling the following problematic Dockerfile \n\n```dockerfile\nFROM node:22.5.1-alpine3.19 AS base\n\nCOPY package.json package-lock.json /workspace/\nRUN npm install\n\nFROM base AS build\n\nCOPY . /workspace  # package*.json overwrite\nRUN npm run build\n```\n\nA correct `base` [Dockerfile](https://github.com/wgkassem/wgkassem.github.io/blob/main/Dockerfile) target is:\n\n```dockerfile\nFROM node:22.5.1-alpine3.19 AS base\n\nRUN apk add --no-cache git\nWORKDIR /workspace\nCOPY package.json /workspace/\nRUN npm ci\n```\n\n`npm ci` installs the exact dependencies listed in `package-lock.json` and does not modify `package.json` or `package-lock.json`.\n\n## Just build\n\nThe build target should not contain any `npm install` or `npm ci` commands. It should only contain the build command as everything *should* be installed in the base target.\n\n```dockerfile\nFROM base AS build\n\nCOPY . /workspace\nRUN npm run build\n```\n\n## Three: handling updates to `package.json` and `package-lock.json`\n\nThis required a little bit of creativity. Here's what we want to accomplish:\n\n1. A dev env a.k.a \"change, build, test\" workflow in \"real-time\".\n1. Avoid maintain two separate Dockerfiles.\n1. Allow changes to `package.json` and `package-lock.json` to git-commit.\n\n### The `dev` service\n\nFrom the `base` target, **mount** the source tree (instead of `COPY`). Ergo, the dev can/must run `npm install` / `npm ci` to update dependencies or node modules.\n\nThen `npm run build` to build the site with any new changes.\n\nThe service runs a persistent shell process.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n\nIf you wanted to use `docker` to re-build then you should probably use the prod target of the main Dockerfile instead.\n\n\n### The `serve` service\n\nSince we cannot now serve (i.e. run `nginx`) from the same container we are goingto use a separate service for that.\n\nThe serice as such binds to the source tree where `public/` is generated by `dev` service and runs nginx with default args.\n\n## Notes:\n\n1. `npm ci` disregards `node_modules`.
